Without a lot of hooplas, DJI has announced the initially ever 6K 30fps aerial compact camera.
It includes a larger sensor than its predecessor and fulfills many filmmakers dreams.
The all-new DJI Zenmuse X7 camera allows filming cinematic aerials with a compact allrounder drone. That is clearly a milestone in the market.
The X7 works with with DJIs professional Inspire 2 drone that's small and light and may be brought everywhere.
In the future, the new DJI X7 is supposed to be appropriate for other DJI drones and systems as well.

One of the major highlights of the brand new camera is it has the cinematic 35 mm sensor (23.5 x 15.7 mm), which provides up to 14 stops dynamic range, supplying the editor a great deal of possibilities in post-production.

The camera records RAW footage in 6K at up to 30fps, while if recording in 3.9K you can pick a maximum of 59.95fps for real slow-motion recordings.
The picture specs sound promising as well: the all-innovative DJI Zenmuse X7 includes a resolution of 24MP.

A major highlight may be the brand-new 35 mm sensor,
offering 14 stops powerful range

Like it's predecessor the Zenmuse X7 camera runs on the CineCore 2.1 processor chip to create DNG RAW or Apple ProRes data.
The 6K clips are becoming saved to a particular DJI CineSSD card that should be purchased separately, as well as the permit keys for both formats.

Pilots and filmmakers who have don't see the need of recording in 6K RAW can always use an easy MicroSD cards to record normal H.264 or H.265 (for videos) or JPEGS or DNG (for photos).

The DJI Zenmuse X7 camera is three-axis stabilized and includes a DL zoom lens mount. It presently works with four prime lenses: 16, 24, 35 and 50 mm.

The 16 mm F2.8 wide-angle lens posseses an inbuilt ND filter.
It's not only more comfortable, nonetheless it saves considerable time, as there is absolutely no further have to balance a lens immediately after applying a filter.

Worth mentioning may be the lenses leaf shutter that minimizes the ugly rolling shutter impact, simplifies interior shootings with artificial mild and prevents scattered mild from entering the lens.

The Zenmuse X7 currently supports four
prime lenses: 16, 24, 35 and 50 mm.

Engineered for Excellence
The X7 runs on the Super 35 sensor, and its high readout speed helps RAW output at 6K/30 fps and 3.9K/59.94 fps. The pixel size gets to 3.91?m and the diagonal lenght of the sensor is 26.6mm when documenting. A sensor this size supplies a higher sensivity to light and 14 stops of dynamic range - much wider compared to the 12.8 stops featured on the Zenmuse X5S. Furthermore, the SNR of the X7 is 46 dB, 8 dB greater than the X5S, and the tonal range is high as 9.41 bits. Most of these features present unlimited creative options for better workflow in the virtually all demanding conditions on set.

DJI Dl-Mount System
Taking advantage of fresh FSI-Cu technology, the X7's sensor feature thinner interconnection, allowing mild to attain the sensing area via a larger incident angle for elevated photosensitivity. This enables a far more compact zoom lens mount to be utilized upon this sensor while maintaining excellent image quality.
The flange focal distance of the DL-Mount is significantly less than 17mm- roughly 1/3 of how big is PL-Mount. Such a compact mount signifies that the X7 weighs no more than 630g with a zoom lens included. Alongside one another, the X7 and Inspire 2 weigh around just 4kg with the ability to catch the same challenging photos as considerably more heavy-duty setups weighing up to 40kg.

DL Lenses
DJI presents four prime lenses for the DL-Mount program, with focal lenghts which range from 16-50mm and resolutions of up to 8K. Made of lightweight carbon fibers and created by world-leading optics teams, the four lenses have been embedded with advance technologies crafted especially for the X7's high-end image sensor.

Conclusion: the all-new DJI Zenmuse X7 camera may be the go-to option for professional filmmakers who exactly need a tiny and easy-to-handle aerial set up.
It's 6K RAW video camera offers a huge amount of creative options.
In the event that you own a DJI Inspire 2 drone, it might seem of buying an X7 camera to improve your production level drastically.
